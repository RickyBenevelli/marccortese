        "text": "Marc Cortese is a multi-instrumentalist from the United States. In 2012 he traveled to Italy in search of his roots and since then has been traveling both Italy and Europe as a drummer/front man for various touring acts.\nThe restrictions of the Covid era put a halt to live music but it was during this time that he adapted to the new situation by dedicating himself fully to writing, recording, and music production.\nThis process lead to ‘six songs’ his first EP (released October 14th 2022) which he entirely self produced, both singing and playing all the instruments. The project is a wide-ranging mix of soul, psychedelia, and experimental pop."
